# <PORTFOLIO>

## Description

- My motivation for this project was to apply adveanced skills, knowledge, and tools learned on class and see how they affect the content and style of the webpage.
- I built this project primarily with the intention of applying advanced CSS properties such as Flexbox to practice how to mock up a certain web page layout, pseudo to provide some interactivity, and media queries to provide responsiveness.
- The code was created to show semantic elements, proper CSS styling elements, a descriptive title to mock up the example provided.
- I learned how to properly start an HTML and CSS file from scratch, through trial an error, google research, study groups, and tutoring I was able to come up with the expected result
